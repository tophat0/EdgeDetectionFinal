# EdgeDetectionFinal

**By: Peyton Slater, Eric Gomez**

# How to Run

1. Download the zip file and open it in a Python editor or terminal.
2. Use the terminal to navigate to the project_root directory.
3. Find your `python.exe` path:
   - On Windows, run the following command in the terminal: `where python`
   - On Linux, run: `which python`
4. Copy the path and run the following command in the terminal:
   ```bash
   (Path) -m app.main


# Output Folder

The "output" folder contains images that have been processed using various edge detection algorithms. Each image corresponds to a different algorithm applied to the input image.

## Edge Detection Algorithms

1. **Edge Detection**: Image processed using a general edge detection method.
2. **Canny Edge Detection**: Image processed using the Canny edge detection algorithm.
3. **Prewitt Edge Detection**: Image processed using the Prewitt edge detection operators.
4. **Log Edge Detection**: Image processed using the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) edge detection.
5. **Sobel Edges**: Image processed using the Sobel operators for horizontal and vertical gradients.
6. **Hed Detection**: Image processed using the HED (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection) algorithm.

Feel free to explore and compare the results of each algorithm on the input images.
